DATASET REPORT — LEVEL 3
========================

Scope
-----
Acoustic texture analysis only.
No speech detection. No semantic labels.
Chunked, resume-safe processing.

Processing Model
----------------
Chunk duration (sec): 30.0
Sample rate: 16000
Features: RMS variance, spectral flatness, bandwidth, centroid

Regime Overview
---------------
Total chunks: 7330
Bursty chunks: 0
Stationary chunks: 7330
Wideband chunks: 51
Narrowband chunks: 7279

Interpretation Constraints
--------------------------
- Bursty does not imply events
- Stationary does not imply noise
- Wideband does not imply speech
- Regimes are structural, not semantic

Nesting Status
--------------
Layer 3 established (acoustic regimes).
Compatible with Layers 0–2.
