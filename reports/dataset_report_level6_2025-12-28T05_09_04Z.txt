DATASET REPORT — LEVEL 6
========================

Scope
-----
Cross-layer consistency audit.
Examines agreement and friction between layers.
No ground truth assumptions.

Summary Counts
--------------
spectral_energy_conflicts: 21
quiet_stable_agreements: 1

What This Reveals
-----------------
- Where compression preserves structure
- Where layers disagree
- Which files behave unusually across scales

Interpretation Constraints
--------------------------
- Anomalies are not errors
- Agreements are not correctness
- This layer diagnoses structure, not meaning

Nesting Status
--------------
Layer 6 established (cross-layer audit).
Provides pressure feedback to Layers 2–5.
