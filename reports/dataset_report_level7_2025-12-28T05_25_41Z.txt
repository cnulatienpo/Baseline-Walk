DATASET REPORT — LEVEL 7
========================

Scope
-----
Focused rescans of anomaly regions only.
Ultra-fine temporal and spectral resolution.
Bounded, targeted computation.

Targets
-------
Files rescanned: 21
Focused windows analyzed: 0

Why These Regions Matter
------------------------
- Cross-layer disagreement zones
- High structural information density
- Compression stress points

Interpretation Constraints
--------------------------
- Rescans deepen structure, not meaning
- High entropy is not speech
- Irregularity is not error

Nesting Status
--------------
Layer 7 established (targeted anomaly deepening).
Feeds back into Layers 3–6.
