DATASET REPORT — LEVEL 9
========================

Scope
-----
Timeline visualization of acoustic regimes.
Anomaly windows overlaid.
Purpose: reveal compression stress and disagreement.

How to Read the Plots
--------------------
- Bursty = rapid energy change
- Wideband = spectrally flat
- Red bands = anomaly rescans

What to Look For
----------------
- Long stable bands → compressible structure
- Rapid oscillation → volatile regions
- Red overlays inside stable zones → hidden complexity
- Red overlays at boundaries → transition stress

Nesting Status
--------------
Layer 9 established (visual diagnostics).
Supports interpretation of Layers 3–7.
